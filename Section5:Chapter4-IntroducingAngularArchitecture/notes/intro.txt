Component = HTMl + TypeScript code 


There are 4 files in the Component file structure
1. HTML - my-Component.html
2. CSS -  my-Component.css
3. Class - my-Component.ts  -> for writing TS code
4. Spec - my-Component.spec.ts -> used for unit testing

app-root - present in the index.html links to components selector 

Decorator =  @Component, So within the decorator we have selector,templateUrl,styleUrls
@Component({
  selector: 'app-root', -> links to index.html, mainly used for recogizing the component w.r.t name
  templateUrl: './app.component.html', -> links to html file
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css'] -> links to css file
})
